    <h2>Hey Daisy,</h2>
    <p>
      It's another year past. You've not had it the easiest through the year. The highlight of it would probably be meeting me for the first timeðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜‚. On a more serious note, I have made all this just to appreciate you and say happy birthday in a more dramatic fashion. I wish you all the best that life has to offer. I wish you sense, lots of it. And also, the ability to see things with two eyes, 'cause your tunnel vision thing is quite annoying sometimes. You are a wonderful person, flaws inclusive and I have been saying that from day one because I mean it. Don't change, but pleeeeaaase changeðŸ˜‚. Here's to more beautiful years aheadðŸ¥‚. PS. Don't like people so quickly in this new year. I am not going to be emotional support again ooðŸ˜‚. Oh, and I love you. Should really say that more often but you'll just make it weird.
    </p>
