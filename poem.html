    <h2>For Daisy</h2>
    <p>
      She is like the moon, her beauty shows in the dark,<br>
      Her glow, a quiet fire, a beacon through the night.<br>
      She moves like the air, swift and unassuming,<br>
      Yet her presence lingers, a whisper forever blooming.<br><br>
      She twists and turns like the waves of the sea,<br>
      Crashing against the shore, wild and free.<br>
      She was never one to shirk a challenge, bold as a lion,<br>
      With a heart unyielding, fierce as the sun in July.<br><br>
      She was broken, fixed, and then broken some more,<br>
      Yet each crack became a window, a way to love deeper than before.<br>
      I've seen her at worse times, yet her beauty is always visible,<br>
      A testament to resilience, her spirit indefatigable.<br><br>
      Today, she is a year older, no doubt wiser,<br>
      Her laughter a melody, her dreams rising higher.<br>
      And though it only gets tougher, I believe in her,<br>
      For she is the storm and the calm, a force that will always endure.
